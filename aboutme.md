### My name is Ryan Wallis

I am the Phenotypic Screening Facility Deputy Manager at the Blizard Institute (QMUL). I support researchers using automated high throughput microscopes (INCA 2200 & 6000), automated slide multiplex imaging (Cell DIVE) and staining (BAB200 & Leica BOND RXm), liquid handling robotics (Cybio Felix) and automated cell seeding (Thermo MultiDrop). I also provide bioinformatics and data analysis support using automated high-content (Developer ToolBox, INCarta, MetaXpress) and multiplexed (HALO) image analysis software. 

I have a particular interest in integrating machine learning within high-content imaging workflows with a focus on multiparametric morphological analysis.

I am also developing cutting-edge machine-learning pipelines to exploit high-content imaging data for senescent cell classification.

This website is a summary of my bioinformatics experience which includes phenotypic screening, transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. I have a particular interest in using AI to probe complex biological datasets in the context of drug discovery.
