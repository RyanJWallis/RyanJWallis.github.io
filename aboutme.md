### Ryan Wallis
#### Deputy Manager, Phenotypic Screening Facility
#### Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)

My role involves supporting users from both academia and industry across a wide range of advanced screening and spatial biology platforms, including:

- Multiplexed spatial immunofluorescence: **Cell DIVE and Phenocycler Fusion**  
- Automated slide staining and robotic automation: **Leica BOND RX,  BAB200, PAA plate handlers**  
- Automated high-throughput microscopy: **INCA 2200 & 6000**  
- Liquid handling robotics: **Cybio Felix and Thermo MultiDrop**  
- Digital pathology and high-content image analysis: **HALO, Developer ToolBo and INCarta**

I also established and continue to manage the facilityâ€™s bioinformatics service, providing expertise for both basic science and clinical projects, such as:

- Spatial biology analyses: **Cell neighbourhoods, cell phenotypes, and spatial relationships**
- Spatial transcriptomics analysis: **VisumHD 10x Genomics**
- Development of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for prognostic assessment in cancer  
- Machine-learning pipelines to exploit high-content imaging data for drug discovery
- Delivering general introductions to coding, with a particular focus on R  

This website serves as a showcase of some of my completed projects, as well as a summary of my experience.
