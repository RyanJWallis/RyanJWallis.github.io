### My name is Ryan Wallis

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London, using high throughput drug screening to identify novel pro-senescence compounds in breast cancer. 

I am also developing cutting-edge machine-learning pipelines to exploit high-content imaging data for senescent cell classification.

This website is a summary of my bioinformatics experience which includes phenotypic screening, transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. I have a particular interest in using AI to probe complex biological datasets in the context of drug discovery.
