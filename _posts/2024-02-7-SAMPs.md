A project I independently developed, which exploited existing high content imaging datasets. Through the use of sophisticated multidimensional phenotypic profiling, I demonstrated that senescent cells have an altered morphology and that this is likely to be a useful "first-pass" tool for classification in contexts such as drug screening. I also showed this to be an effective method of senescence characterisation _in vivo_.
