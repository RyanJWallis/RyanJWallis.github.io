In this work, we developed a machine learning method to classify senescent cells via single-cell RNA sequencing data.

My contributions focused on conceptual development and coding troubleshooting. 

This gave me experience working with RNA-sequencing data, including using Seurat objects and monocle trajectory analysis. 

The work demonstrates that 2D _in vitro_ models of senescence poorly recapitulate _in vivo_ conditions. However, using complex 3D cellular models combined with sophisticated sc-RNAseq analysis provides a more reliable means of detecting senescence. The work also demonstrates the value of high-dimensional phenotype assessment as opposed to reliance on a smaller number of limited "hallmarks".
