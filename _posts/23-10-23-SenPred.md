I collaborated on this work utilising machine learning to develop a classification tool for senescent cells via single-cell RNA sequencing data. My contributions mainly focused on conceptual development and coding troubleshooting. This gave me experience working with RNA-sequencing data, including using Seurat objects and monocle trajectory analysis. 

The work demonstrates that 2D _in vitro_ models of senescence poorly recapitulate _in vivo_ conditions. However, using complex 3D cellular models combined with sophisticated sc-RNAseq analysis provides a more reliable means of detecting senescence. The work also demonstrates the value of high dimensionality phenotype assessment as opposed to reliance on a smaller number of limited "hallmarks".
