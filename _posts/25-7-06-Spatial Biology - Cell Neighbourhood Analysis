Multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging enables the characterisation of a large number of biomarkers within single tissue sections or tissue microarrays.

I have conducted projects in collaboration with academic and industry partners using both the **Cell DIVE** and **PhenoCycler Fusion** platforms to image up to 60 antibodies simultaneously. This allows for comprehensive identification and profiling of diverse cell populations.

For the bioinformatics analysis of these datasets, I employed a range of spatial biology techniques, including **cell proximity**, **immune infiltration**, and **nearest-neighbour analysis**.

A key area of interest in my research is the exploration of **"Cell Neighbourhoods"**, which enables the stratification of tissue based on the spatial distribution and interactions of cells. I have developed advanced analysis pipelines for assessing these neighbourhoods across several projects, including:

- Development of a **prognostic model for oral cancer**
- Assessment of **immune cell populations** in cancer across different ethnic backgrounds, tissue regions, and cancer types
- Analysis of the **distribution of senescent cells** within human skin
