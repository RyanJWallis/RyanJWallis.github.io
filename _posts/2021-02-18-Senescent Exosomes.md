This project was my introduction to bioinformatics. I utilised R/RStudio to analyse and visualise 3 large-scale mass spectrometry datasets through a combination of heatmaps, volcano plots, gene ontology, hierarchical clustering and principle content analysis (PCA). I published the majority of the work in the Journal of Extracellular Vesicles. The final dataset remains unpublished but is publicly available via the link to my thesis.  

**ML Techniques: PCA, gene ontology, hierarchical clustering**
