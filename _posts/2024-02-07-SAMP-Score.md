Development of a machine learning tool for senescence classification based on previous SAMP methodology. SAMP-Score has been built and utilised through analysis of high throughput screening data and multiparameter phenotypic analysis:

- Genome-wide siRNA (x63 384-well plates – 24,122 treatments).
- Compound diversity library (x61 384-well plates – 20,000 treatments).
- Hit validation dose response (x30 384-well plates – 8,940 treatments).

SAMP-Score has been used to identify novel compounds that initiate a senescence response in cancer cells, demonstrating its utility as a drug discovery tool. 

**ML Techniques: Regression (Logistic), Regularisation (Lasso, Elastic Net), Support vector machines (SVM), Decision trees (Random Forrest), Dimensionality reduction (MDA), Neural networks, Ensemble model stacking and Hierarchical clustering**
