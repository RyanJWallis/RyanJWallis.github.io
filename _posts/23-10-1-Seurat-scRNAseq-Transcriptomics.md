Seurat is an R package frequently employed for the QC, analysis, and exploration of single-cell RNA-seq data.

Here, I have explored several example datasets to gain familiarity analysing high-dimensional transcriptomics data. 

This provided experience working with these types of data and allowed me to support the subsequent SenPred ML classification project. 

## Methods
- Quality control
- Normalization
- Dimensionality reduction
- Clustering
- Visualization
- Differential expression analysis
- Integration

## Outputs
- Identified cell clusters representing different types.
- Visualized clusters and marker genes.
- Detected differential gene expression.
- Integrated multiple datasets.
