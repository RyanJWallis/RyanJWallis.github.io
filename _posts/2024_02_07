Development of a machine learning tool for senescence classification based on previous SAMP methodology. SAMP-Score has been built and utilised through analysis of high throughput screening and multiparameter phenotypic analysis. 

- Genome-wide siRNA (x63 384-well plates – 24,122 treatments).
- Compound diversity library (x61 384-well plates – 20,000 treatments).
- Hit validation dose response (x30 384-well plates – 8,940 treatments).
