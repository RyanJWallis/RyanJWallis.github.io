As part of an ongoing user project, I have been working to mine published spatial transcriptomics data generated via the 10x Visium platform.

This involved data wrangling in Python in order to consolidate tissue positions, spot annotations, scale factors and feature counts into a workable data matrix.

I then moved into R where I explored transcript expression across different regions by generating a range of visualisations and quantiations. 

This is part of a large, ongoing project, exploring spatial data across differing multi-omics datasets.
