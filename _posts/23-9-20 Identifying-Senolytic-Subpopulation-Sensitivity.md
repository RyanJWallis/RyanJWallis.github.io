Having previously shown that heterogeneity exists within senescent cells and that this can be identified via senescence-associated morphological profiles (SAMPs), I aimed to develop a methodology for identifying subpopulation vulnerability to senolytic clearance. Early proliferation (EP) and Deeply Senescent (DS) adult human dermal fibroblasts were treated with either DMSO or one of two novel senolytic agents (CompA/B), identified through compound screening. Using K-means cluster analysis of SAMP profiles, subpopulations of DS cells were defined within the DMSO condition. Different clusters were shown to vary in susceptibility to senescence clearance, opening the possibility for future combination treatment strategies targeting specific subpopulations.
