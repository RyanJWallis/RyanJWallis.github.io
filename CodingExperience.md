## Formal Courses
−	DataCamp “Data Scientist with R” track (88-hour online course).

−	Biochemical society “R for Biochemists 101” (5-week online introduction to R).

−	LinkedIn Learning “Become a Data Scientist” (17hr introductory course).

−	Enrolled on DataCamp “Data Analyst with Python” track (36-hour online course).

## Phenotypic Screening 
−	Extensive use of R to analyse and visualise high content image analysis (HCA) data.

−	Analysis of multiple large-scale screening datasets (genetic and compound – 20,000+ treatments)

−	HCA data visualisation through heatmaps, frequency distributions, and dimensionality reduction.

−	Development of standardised analysis pipelines for screening data via HCA protocols and R.

## Multiparameter Phenotypic Profiling (“Phenomics”)
−	Produced publication (Aging 2022) showing phenotypic profiles are a hallmark of senescence.

−	Developed machine learning classification tool for compound screening (in preparation).

−	Developed phenocopying methodology to genetic (siRNA) screen to support target identification.

−	Employed single target k-means cluster analysis to identify subpopulation compound sensitivity.

−	Application of QuPath image analysis software and R to assess senescence in vivo.  

## Transcriptomic and Proteomic Analysis

−	Supported development of sc-RNAseq senescence classification ML tool (Hughes et al., bioRxiv 2023).

   - _Contributed to manuscript through coding troubleshooting (including use of Seurat objects and Monocle trajectory analysis) and conceptual development (ML focus)_
  
−	Analysis/visualisation of proteomics data from conditioned media and exosomes.
