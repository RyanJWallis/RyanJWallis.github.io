### Bioinformatics Service
I established and lead the phenotypic screening facilityâ€™s bioinformatics service, providing bespoke computational support to academic and industry users. This chargeable service supports a wide range of life science disciplines, including cancer biology, immunology, neuroscience, developmental biology, and skin research.

I specialise in deriving insights from complex imaging and omics datasets and in developing scalable, reproducible analysis pipelines to advance cutting-edge research.

I also promote best practice and version control through the facility github page

### Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
I have a particular interest in applying machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to solve complex biological problems and have successfully implemented these approaches across diverse data types.

#### Techniques:
**Supervised learning**: Logistic regression, Lasso regularisation, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Multiple Discriminant Analysis, Neural Networks
**Unsupervised learning**: Hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), UMAP/TSNE

#### Projects:
**SAMP-Score**: Ensemble machine learning model for senescence detection to support drug discovery in cancer <a href="https://ryanjwallis.github.io/2024-02-07-SAMP-Score/" target="_blank">Project Link</a>

**SenPred**: Senescence classification model for single-cell RNA sequencing transcriptomic data developed from 3D _in vitro_ cell culture models <a href="https://ryanjwallis.github.io/2023-10-23-SenPred/" target="_blank">Project Link</a>

Prognostic multiplexed immunofluorescence model utilising the spatial assessment in oral epithelial dysplasia
