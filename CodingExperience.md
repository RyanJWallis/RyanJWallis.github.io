### Bioinformatics Service
I established and lead the phenotypic screening facility’s bioinformatics service, providing bespoke computational support to academic and industry users. This chargeable service supports a wide range of life science disciplines, including cancer biology, immunology, neuroscience, developmental biology, and skin research.

I specialise in deriving insights from complex imaging and omics datasets and in developing scalable, reproducible analysis pipelines to advance cutting-edge research.

I also promote best practice and version control through the <a href="https://github.com/Phenotypic-Screening-QMUL" target="_blank">phenotypic screening facility GitHub</a>

### Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
I have a particular interest in applying machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to solve complex biological problems and have successfully implemented these approaches across diverse data types.

#### Techniques:
**Supervised learning**: Logistic regression, Lasso regularisation, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Multiple Discriminant Analysis, Neural Networks
**Unsupervised learning**: Hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)

#### Projects:
**SAMP-Score**: Ensemble machine learning model for senescence detection to support drug discovery in cancer - <a href="https://ryanjwallis.github.io/2024-02-07-SAMP-Score/" target="_blank">Project Link</a>
**SenPred**: Senescence classification model for single-cell RNA sequencing transcriptomic data developed from 3D _in vitro_ cell culture models - <a href="https://ryanjwallis.github.io/2023-10-23-SenPred/" target="_blank">Project Link</a>
Prognostic multiplexed immunofluorescence model utilising the spatial assessment in oral epithelial dysplasia (_manuscript in preparation_)

### High-Content Image Analysis
I have extensive experience analysing large-scale imaging data from both compound and genetic screens, as well as developing tools for drug discovery. 

#### Techniques
**Analysis**: Z-Scores, cluster-analysis, IC50s, batch normalisation
**Visualisations**: Heatmaps, frequency distributions, dimensionality reduction (UMAP/TSNE)

#### Projects:
Unsupervised characterisation of senescence via phenotypic assessment of morphology - <a href="https://ryanjwallis.github.io/22022-05-16-SAMPs/" target="_blank">Project Link</a>

Developed a phenocopying methodology comparing to a genome-wide siRNA screen to support target identification for a novel compound (_in evaluation phase with commercial partner_) - <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/blizard/about/news/items/queen-mary-research-team-heads-discovery-of-a-new-method-to-stop-the-growth-of-cancer-cells.html" target="_blank"> Press Release </a>

Developed a range of reusable pipelines and workflows, as well as HTML guides for users to standardise the analysis of imaging data  <a href="https://github.com/Phenotypic-Screening-QMUL/InCarta-Scripts" target="_blank"> GitHub: Analysis Scripts </a>
