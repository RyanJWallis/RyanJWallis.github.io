title: Lab Experience
---
**Whilst I am looking to transition into a bioinformatic role, I also have extensive wet lab experience and understanding of cutting-edge platforms.**

### Spatial Profiling
- Experience with multiplexed spatial imaging platforms including **Cell DIVE** and **PhenoCycler Fusion**.
- Have run projects dealing with high volumes of slides (50+ Cell DIVE) or biomarkers (60-plex Phenocycler)
  
--- 

### Drug Discovery and Screening
- Numerous rounds of lead optimisation as part of a multidisciplinary cross-University team (Dundee Drug Discovery Unit) to explore series structural activity relationships, consistently delivering on time in a highly milestones-driven project.
- Conducted high-throughput compound screening in 384-well format across multiple cancer cell lines.
- Operated IN Cell Analyzer 2200/6000 (including confocal mode) for high-content automated imaging.

### Automation and Robotic Integration
- Robotic automation experience using platforms such as PAA and CyBio FeliX for high-throughput liquid handling and assay miniaturisation.
- Operated BOND Rx automated slide stainer for multiplexed staining protocols.
- BAB robotics for Cell DIVE workflow automation.

### Cell Biology & Senescence Models
- Long-term culture of adult primary cells (>200 days), including antibiotic free culture and use of 3D spheroid models.
- Experienced with multiple senescence models: replicative (RS), oncogene-induced (OIS), therapy-induced (TIS), and paracrine senescence.
- Maintained a range of cancer cell lines (e.g. MB-468, MB-231, BT549, HCC1937, HeLa) in antibiotic-free conditions.
  
### Extracellular Vesicle (EV) Isolation & Characterisation
- EV isolation via ultracentrifugation and size-exclusion chromatography.
- Characterisation using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and nano-flow cytometry.
  
### Molecular Biology Techniques
- Proficient in standard laboratory techniques including Western blotting, ELISA, PCR, and qPCR.
