**Whilst I am looking to transition into a bioinformatic role, I also have extensive wet lab experience.**

### Drug Discovery

−	Numerous rounds of lead optimisation as part of a multidisciplinary cross-University team (Dundee Drug Discovery Unit) to explore series structural activity relationships, consistently delivering on time in a highly milestones-driven project.

−	Delivered a lead series which has progressed into an evaluation phase with a commercial partner (NDA protection) balancing commercial and scientific challenges.


### Screening and High Content Automated Microscopy
−	Use of IN Cell Analyser 2200/6000 for automated image acquisition (incl. confocal)

−		Compound screening in 384-well plate format in multiple cancer cell lines

### Primary Cell Culture
−	Long-term culture of adult primary cells (>200 days)

−	 Models of senescence (RS , OIS , TIS , paracrine)

−	 Cancer cell lines (MB-468s , MB-231s , BT549s , HCC1937s , HeLas)

−	3D in vitro models (spheroids)

−	Antibiotic-free cell culture
  
### EV Isolation and Characterisation Techniques
−	Ultracentrifugation
  
−	 Size- exclusion chromatography
  
−	Nanoparticle tracking analysis
  
−	 Nano Flow Cytometry

### Standard molecular biology techniques:

−	 Western blot , ELISA , PCR , qPCR
